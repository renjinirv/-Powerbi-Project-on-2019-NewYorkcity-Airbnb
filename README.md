Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their property with people who are looking for accommodations, typically for short stay.
Here, I have tried to visualize the Airbnb data of New York City in 2019. Data cleaning is done and preprocessed to  retrieve relevant information. Data explorations are done for easy analysis and visualisations. Based on this analysis, some outcomes are drawn from the dataset.
